# StudyWorks NG installation parameters
#
# ***** PLEASE READ THIS ******
#
# This is a template configuration file containing parameters used
# by StydyWorks NG installer.
#
# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE. Instead:
# 
# Make a COPY of this file, and edit the copy.
# Save the copy somewhere OUTSIDE the installer directory,
# e.g. in $HOME.  When you run the installer (setup.sh) you will
# specify the path to your edited copy on the command line.
#
# After you have successfully installed StudyWorks, your settings
# file is not referenced by the installed product. Since your
# settings file will contain clear-text passwords, you should then
# ENCRYPT it on disk.  Do not delete it, as you will probably need
# it again for future installs/upgrades of StudyWorks NG.
#
# NOTE: This is not a shell script file;
# $ variables and ~ expansion will not work here.
# Backslashes are not special; in particular, they can't be used
# to continue long lines.
#
# Values that are enclosed in brackets >|LIKE_THIS|< have no 
# default and MUST be filled in. For other values, reasonable
# defaults have been provided, but these should still be reviewed
# and changed as approprite.
#

# DEVELOPERS: Under Cygwin, use C:\pure\dos\backslashes style
#             for all file or directory PATH's except as noted
#             in comments for each setting.


[Tomcat]

# The location of tomcat install, e.g. /usr/local/tomcat
TomcatHome = /usr/local/tomcat7

# The parent directory of Tomcat's webapps and config, which might be 
# different from TomcatHome.  This would be the same value as your
# CATALINA_BASE, if you use such a setup.
TomcatBase = /home/ops/tomcat-inst

# NOTE: This installer will OVERWRITE TomcatBase/conf/server.xml
# with a server.xml containing two <Service> definitions, with
# these port numbers.
#
# In a production environment:
# - Port 80 and port 443 must be exposed to the WAN
#   However, Tomcat will actually listening on two other ports, instead,
#   the "PublicHttpPort" and "PublicHttpsPort", below, so as not to have
#   to run as root.
# - Ports 80 and 443 are then forwarded to these high-numbered ports
#   with some iptables -t nat  entries.
# - Both of the Private* ports must be BLOCKED to the outside world
#   It is ** CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ** that these ports are not open to 
#   the WAN, as they are bound to some internal, non-secured services
# - All four port numbers below must be above 1024, and not used by other
#   services.

# The HTTP port for private apps, which must NOT be exposed to the WAN
PrivateHttpPort = 8080

# The HTTPS port for private apps, which must NOT be exposed to the WAN either!
PrivateHttpsPort = 8443

# The HTTP port for public apps, which can be EXPOSED to the WAN (not important)
PublicHttpPort = 8081

# The HTTPS port for public apps, which can be EXPOSED to the WAN (not important)
PublicHttpsPort = 8444

# Certificate for HTTPS
# The KeyStore file containing the certificate (FULL path)
KeystoreFile = >|FILE_PATH|<

# The KeyStore password
KeystorePassword = >|PASSWORD|<
CertificateAlias = >|CERT_ALIAS|<


#
# Parameters for connection to SQL Server
#
[Database]

# The host name or IP address of the SQL Server instance
DBHost = >|HOSTNAME|<

# The database instance name (not including machine name); leave completely blank after = if not applicable
DBInstance = >|INST_NAME|<

# The database user, e.g. sa
DBUser = >|USER_NAME|<

# The database password, e.g. password

#
# Parameters specific to StudyWorks NG services
#
[StudyWorksNG]

# The path to where the NG config (.properties) files will be put,
#  e.g. /usr/local/ng-config (must have write access to this)

# Host name where the SMTP service is running
SMTPServer = >|HOSTNAME|<

# Emails sent by StudyWorks NG will be "from" this email address
AdminEmailAddress = >|EMAIL|<


#
# Parameters specific to the File Storage Service
#
[FileStorageService]

# The path to the root directory of the file store for the
# file-storage service. This directory must already exist.
# The production VM's should be configured with a dedicated
# file system for this purpose, mounted at /cifs/storage, so
# that value is pre-filled in as the default here. It should not
# be changed, except in testing environments.
#
# Developers: Under Cygwin, use C:/forward/slashes/not/backslashes NOT pure dos style
#             >| Unix style path provided below is not appropriate under Cygwin |<
FileStorageRoot = /cifs/storage

# The following parameters pertain to the SMB share that gets mounted
# at the above location. These are the the credentials that windows
# requires for access to the share DocumentStorage share. Refer to IQ
# for details about how this share should be set up.
SmbDomain = >|DOMAIN|<
SmbHost = >|HOSTNAME|<
SmbUser = >|USER_NAME|<
SmbPassword = >|PASSWORD|<

# This setting can be set to true to bypass the automated setup of the
# automounting of the DocumentStorage SMB share.  Even if the mount is already
# set up, it is safe, and recommended, to perform this setup anyway.
SkipCifsSetup = false

# The maximum size of a file upload, in bytes, that will be accepted by the system
UploadSizeMax = 4000000000

# Miscellaneous Java VM options.
[JavaVM]

# set initial Java heap size e.g. 512m
JavaInitialMemSize = 512m

# set maximum Java heap size e.g. 2048m
JavaMaximumMemSize = 2048m

# set java thread stack size, e.g. 512m
JavaThreadStackSize = 512m

# Black magic is performed here

# This section pertains to the reporting database and the
# ETL tool that populates it.
#
# *** If you are not ready to install the ETL tool yet, 
#     and just want to get the Logging Service itself going
#     you can leave this section exactly as is, for now.
#
# Currently, ETL must be configured to run in the
# same instance as the Logging Service; thus the [Database]
# section, above, applies to ETL, as well.

[ETL]

# Where to put ETL files; recommended path is C:\SSIS
SSISDir = C:\SSIS

# Polling interval, in minutes; recommended is 5

# Host name or IP address of Tomcat as seen by the SQL Server VM

# Windows Administrator login, usually of the form MACHINENAME\Administrator

SSISLoginPassword = >!PASSWORD!<

# Name of log file that ETL tool will generate; recommended is etl-log.txt
ETLLogFilename = etl-log.txt



# Various logging options.
# Most of these must be set to one of:
# TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL, or OFF
[Logging]

# This is the default logging appender.
# Acceptable values are FILE or STDOUT
# STDOUT is convenient in a develop/test environment, but it should not
# be used in production, as it will eventually fill up disk with logging output.
# FILE uses a rolling-file-appender, which prevents unbounded disk space
# consumption, and should be selected in production.
RootLoggingAppender = FILE

# RootLoggingLevel controls all slf4j logging from all vendors; recommended: WARN
RootLoggingLevel = WARN

# NGLoggingLevel controls logging from all NG code; recommended: DEBUG
NGLoggingLevel = DEBUG

# DebugHttpRequestLoggingLevel controls logging of all request and response content
# must be OFF, or DEBUG; recommend OFF in production, DEBUG in testing
DebugHttpRequestLoggingLevel = DEBUG

# TimerFilterLoggingLevel controls logging of timing info for all requests;
# must be OFF or DEBUG; recommend OFF unless debugging a perf issue
TimerFilterLoggingLevel = OFF

# HibernateShowSql causes every SQL query issued by Hibernate to be printed
# This one must be set to true or false; recommended is false

# The following settings are used for tunneling over SSH.
# Leave these settings blank if you are not using SSH tunneling.
# As an example, let's say you connect to your VM with:
# ssh -R8081:engvmkando:8081 ...
# to tunnel to the Nexus server; then you would set
# Nexus = localhost:8081
