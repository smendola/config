# StudyWorks NG installation parameters
#
# ***** PLEASE READ THIS ******
#
# This is a template configuration file containing parameters used
# by StydyWorks NG installer.
#
# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE. Instead:
# 
# Make a COPY of this file, and edit the copy.
# Save the copy somewhere OUTSIDE the installer directory,
# e.g. in $HOME.  When you run the installer (setup.sh) you will
# specify the path to your edited copy on the command line.
#
# After you have successfully installed StudyWorks, your settings
# file is not referenced by the installed product. Since your
# settings file will contain clear-text passwords, you should then
# ENCRYPT it on disk.  Do not delete it, as you will probably need
# it again for future installs/upgrades of StudyWorks NG.
#
# NOTE: This is not a shell script file;
# $ variables and ~ expansion will not work here.
# Backslashes are not special; in particular, they can't be used
# to continue long lines.
#
# Values that are enclosed in brackets >|LIKE_THIS|< have no 
# default and MUST be filled in. For other values, reasonable
# defaults have been provided, but these should still be reviewed
# and changed as approprite.
#

# In a production environment:
# - Port 80 and port 443 must be exposed to the WAN
# - StudyWorks NextGen does not require any other ports to be exposed;
#   all the port numbers configured in this file are for SWâ€™s internal
#   workings.
# - The PrivateServicesPort under [Tomcat] MUST NOT BE EXPOSED!

# DEVELOPERS: Under Cygwin, use C:\pure\dos\backslashes style
#             for all file or directory PATH's except as noted
#             in comments for each setting.


[Apache]

# This is the fully qualified host name that we tell our
# end users to use, for example, ng.phtstudy.com
ExternalServerName = localhost

# The path to the root directory of the file store for the
# static content. This directory must already exist.
# The production VM's should be configured with a dedicated
# file system for this purpose.

ApacheBin = C:/tools/Apache2.2/bin
ApacheBase = C:/tools/Apache2.2

# The end-user ports are 80 and 443, but Apache does not run as root, so
# cannot attach to those ports. Instead it attaches to the two port numbers
# configured below, which must be above 1024. The install process then maps 
# 80 and 443 to these port numbers, using iptables NAT

# different from TomcatHome.  This would be the same value as your
# CATALINA_BASE, if you use such a setup.
TomcatBase = C:/tools/tomcat

# NOTE: This installer will OVERWRITE TomcatBase/conf/server.xml
# with a server.xml containing two <Service> definitions, with
# these port numbers.
#

# It is CRITICALLY IMPORTANT that this port NOT be open/exposed through the firewall.

# Parameters specific to the File Storage Service
#
[FileStorageService]

# The path to the root directory of the file store for the
# file-storage service. This directory must already exist.
# The production VM's should be configured with a dedicated
# file system for this purpose, mounted at /cifs/storage, so
# that value is pre-filled in as the default here. It should not
# be changed, except in testing environments.

# requires for access to the share DocumentStorage share. Refer to IQ
# for details about how this share should be set up.
SmbDomain = xxx
SmbHost = xxx
SmbUser = xxx
SmbPassword = xxx

# This setting can be set to true to bypass the automated setup of the
# automounting of the DocumentStorage SMB share.  Even if the mount is already

# Various logging options.
# Most of these must be set to one of:
# TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL, or OFF
[Logging]

# This is the default logging appender.
# Acceptable values are FILE or STDOUT
# STDOUT is convenient in a develop/test environment, but it should not
# be used in production, as it will eventually fill up disk with logging output.
# FILE uses a rolling-file-appender, which prevents unbounded disk space
# consumption, and should be selected in production.

# RootLoggingLevel controls all slf4j logging from all vendors; recommended: WARN

# NGLoggingLevel controls logging from all NG code; recommended: DEBUG

# TimerFilterLoggingLevel controls logging of timing info for all requests;
# must be OFF or DEBUG; recommend OFF unless debugging a perf issue
